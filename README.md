Steps after making code changes

1. git add . (use filename if you want to add only specific files)

2. git commit -m "custom message"  (give the message what you have changed)

3. git push  (for pushing the changes from local to remote branch)


Few commands to remember:

1. git status (used for seeing the status about files that are either tracked or not)

2. git diff (to see the difference between current changes and HEAD commit)

3. git log (to see all the commits)
